# 🔐 Supabase Database Integration Setup Guide

## 📋 Overview

This guide will help you set up Supabase as your backend database for the Annita website. Since users will only submit forms and download investor documents (no login/transactions required), this setup is optimized for anonymous form submissions and download tracking. All form submissions and user data will be securely stored in Supabase instead of being lost or exposed publicly.

## 🚀 Step 1: Create Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Sign up/Login to your account
3. Click "New Project"
4. Choose your organization
5. Enter project details:
   - **Name**: `annita-website-db`
   - **Database Password**: Generate a strong password
   - **Region**: Choose closest to your users (e.g., `us-east-1` for US)
6. Click "Create new project"
7. Wait for the project to be set up (2-3 minutes)

## 🗄️ Step 2: Set Up Database Schema

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Copy the entire content from `database-schema.sql`
3. Paste it into the SQL editor
4. Click **Run** to execute the schema
5. Verify all tables are created in **Table Editor**

## 🔑 Step 3: Get API Keys

1. In Supabase dashboard, go to **Settings** → **API**
2. Copy the following values:
   - **Project URL** (e.g., `https://your-project-id.supabase.co`)
   - **anon public** key
   - **service_role** key (keep this secret!)

## ⚙️ Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env.local` file in your project root
2. Add the following variables:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

# Example:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://abc123.supabase.co
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
# SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

## 📦 Step 5: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

## 🛡️ Step 6: Set Up Storage Bucket

1. In Supabase dashboard, go to **Storage**
2. Create a new bucket called `files`
3. Set it to **Private** for security
4. Configure RLS policies for file uploads

## 🔒 Step 7: Configure Row Level Security (RLS)

The database schema includes RLS policies optimized for anonymous form submissions:

1. **Insert policies**: Allow all users to submit forms (no authentication required)
2. **Read policies**: Data access is through Supabase dashboard or service role key
3. **No user authentication**: Since users don't login, all policies are set for anonymous access
4. **Admin access**: Use the service role key for admin dashboard access

## 📊 Step 8: Test the Integration

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Test form submissions on various pages
3. Check Supabase dashboard to see data being stored
4. Verify file uploads work correctly

## 🎯 Step 9: Update Forms (Next Steps)

Now you need to update each form to use the new database integration. Here's what needs to be changed:

### Forms to Update:

1. **Contact Us** (`/contact-us`)
2. **Contact Sales** (`/contact-sales`)
3. **Career Applications** (`/careers`, `/careers/apply`)
4. **Support Issues** (`/support/report-issues`)
5. **Business Inquiries** (`/business-model`)
6. **Pricing Inquiries** (`/pricing`)
7. **The 100 Applications** (`/the100`)
8. **Download/Newsletter** (`/download`)

### Investor Downloads to Track:

1. **Pitch Deck** downloads
2. **Financial Model** downloads
3. **Business Plan** downloads
4. **Executive Summary** downloads
5. **Market Analysis** downloads

### Example Form Update:

```typescript
// Before (local state only)
const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  setIsSubmitting(true)
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000))
  setIsSubmitting(false)
  setIsSubmitted(true)
}

// After (with database integration)
import { useFormSubmission, formValidations } from '@/lib/hooks/useFormSubmission'

const { submitForm, isSubmitting, isSubmitted, error, success } = useFormSubmission({
  validateForm: formValidations.contact,
  onSuccess: (data) => {
    console.log('Form submitted successfully:', data)
  },
  onError: (error) => {
    console.error('Form submission failed:', error)
  }
})

const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  await submitForm('contact', formData)
}
```

## 🔍 Step 10: Monitor and Admin

### View Data in Supabase:
- **Table Editor**: View all form submissions and download tracking
- **SQL Editor**: Run custom queries for analytics
- **Logs**: Monitor API calls and errors

### Data Analytics:
- **Form submissions**: Track all contact forms, applications, and inquiries
- **Download analytics**: Monitor which investor documents are most popular
- **Geographic data**: IP tracking shows where your visitors are from
- **User behavior**: Track which forms and documents get the most engagement

### Create Admin Dashboard (Optional):
- Build a simple admin interface to view submissions
- Use the `recent_inquiries` view for overview
- Track investor document download statistics
- Monitor form submission trends

## 🚨 Security Considerations

1. **Never expose service_role key** in client-side code
2. **Use RLS policies** to control data access
3. **Validate all inputs** on both client and server
4. **Sanitize data** before storing
5. **Monitor for suspicious activity**
6. **Regular backups** of your database

## 📈 Performance Optimization

1. **Indexes**: Already created for common queries
2. **Connection pooling**: Supabase handles this automatically
3. **Caching**: Consider implementing Redis for frequently accessed data
4. **File optimization**: Compress images before upload

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Invalid API key"**: Check your environment variables
2. **"Table doesn't exist"**: Run the database schema again
3. **"RLS policy violation"**: Check your RLS policies
4. **"File upload failed"**: Verify storage bucket configuration

### Debug Steps:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check Supabase logs in dashboard
3. Verify API routes are working
4. Test database connection
